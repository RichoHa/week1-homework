week 1 homework code by Richard (Duc) Ha on the 07/03/2021
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Description:

The project is to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The below are the changes made to the CSS:

1) Used grouped selector for ".search-engine-optimization", ".online-reputation-management" and ".social-media-marketing" together as properties are the same.
2) Used Descendant Selector for Header 2 together as ".content h2" as properties are the same.
3) Used Descendant Selector for all images under class ".content" as the properties are the same.
4) Used Descendant Selector for ".benefit-lead/brand/cost img" as ".benefits img" because the properties are the same.
5) Used Descendant Selector for ".benefit-lead/brand/cost h3" under ".benefits h3" as the properties are the same.
6) Used group selector for "benefit-lead/brand/cost" classes as properties are the same.
7) Moved Element "a" and "p" below "body" as it is an Element.
8) Moved Class Content above Float Left and Float Right, as it is the container.
9) Moved ".search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing" after ".content" to follow ordering of HTML.
10) Moved ".content h2" and ".content img" after ".content" to follow HTML structure.
11) Add comments of the different sections.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes:

1) Had issues launching web-page, so I moved the HTML and assets directory to the root file. 
2) Existing assets directory was re-named to Assets2 due to additional note 1.
